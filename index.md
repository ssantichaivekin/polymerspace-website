Polymerspace is an HMC biohackerspace funded by Shanahan grant. We provide you with laboratory apparatus and funding for your project and other projects you want to join. You can also have us order primers for your project or use our E. coli! Our lab is located at Olin B149, where you can have 24-hour access after going through a safety training.
