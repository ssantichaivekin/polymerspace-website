Polymerspace is an HMC biohackerspace funded by Shanahan grant. Here, we make your biology projects come true! We provide you with laboratory apparatus and funding for your project and for other projects you want to join. You can also have us order primers and use our E. coli! Our lab is located at Olin B149, where you can have 24-hour access after going through the safety training. Click [here] to learn more.
