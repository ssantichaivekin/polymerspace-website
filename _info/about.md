## What is a biohackerspace?
A biohackerspace is a community laboratory that is open to the public where people are encouraged to learn about and experiment with biotechnology. Like a makerspace, a biohackerspace provides people with tools that are usually not available at home. 

## So what are we going to do here?
Professors, excited students, and members of the biohacking community will hold lectures and classes on hacking DNA in the PolymerSpace lab to ignite genetic engineering project ideas, to allow students from all backgrounds to experiment with synthetic biology, and to generate interest in the field. The PolymerSpace lab will encourage the growth of student-conceived and driven project ideas through the review of these ideas, input from other lab members, and advisement from professors and experienced students. The PolymerSpace lab will then provide bench space, equipment, reagents, and mentorship to bring these ideas to life.  The lab will also aim to collaborate with other labs at Harvey Mudd and internationally and pursue interdisciplinarity in the projects it undertakes, the members it recruits, and other areas that may arise.

## What will we provide you?


We will provide you with primers (you can order through us!), E. coli, refrigerator, NanoDrop (UV-vis spectrometer), centrifuge, incubator, PCR apparatus, electroporator, beakers and flasks, lab coats, reimbursement for the things you order, and other things too!
