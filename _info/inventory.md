Please visit [https://goo.gl/AinxcN](https://goo.gl/AinxcN) to access our inventory 
as of August 15th, 2018. 

Our inventory is constantly growing and changing. We are still
working on setting up Quartzy so that we can share our inventory 
in "view" status rather than "edit". If you would like access to our 
Quartzy inventory which is where we update our inventory in real-time, 
then please email [ramininaieni@hmc.edu](mailto:ramininaieni@hmc.edu) with your request.
