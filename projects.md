**2018 Project**: The ultimate aim of the project is synthesizing an artificial radiation detector/recorder circuit in a
radiation resistant bacterium. 

We will be synthesizing a circuit for detecting and reporting the presence of carbonylated
MyBPC in an e. coli expression system, MyBPC is typically bound to F-actin. Under oxidative
stress, MyBPC is carbonylated and dissociates from F-actin (becoming “unbound MyBPC”). One
current idea is to fuse an antibody against carbonylated/unbound MyBPC (i.e., will bind MyBPC if
MyBPC is not bound to actin) to a MAPK-kinase pathway (involved in cell proliferation). The MyBPC
is also fused to a positive modulator. Thus, when MyBPC+positive modulator releases actin and
binds to the antibody, it up-regulates the MAP-K kinase pathway. MyBPC will also link to a
reporter system. (Result: amplified (through MAP-K) reporting).
